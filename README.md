# Learn C# with Mara
*As a disclaimer, Mara is also learning C# and is using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp) as her wonderful guide*

1. First, make sure that you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. Second, download the `C#` extension in VS Code (the four squares in the left sidebar) and then restart VS Code
3. Also, download [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/sdk-for-vs-code?utm_source=vs-code&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sdk-install), it lets you run the apps! Please fully exit out of VS Code before trying to use the command `dotnet`.
